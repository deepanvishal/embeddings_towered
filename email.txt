Hi [Manager Name],
I've completed the provider overlap analysis using our embedding model and wanted to share the key findings. I've attached a comprehensive Excel workbook that breaks down our results.
What This Analysis Shows
Page 1 (Summary): Overview of all detected overlaps across provider specialty labels, showing which provider types are being confused by our model.
Page 2 (Navigation Index): Complete list of specific providers that are misclassified, with their overlap scores. Each case links to detailed analysis.
How We Detect Overlaps
Simple Terms: We identify providers who are far from their own specialty group but close to a different specialty group - indicating the model sees them as more similar to the "wrong" group.
Statistical Approach:

Calculate distance from each provider to their assigned label's centroid
Find providers with distance > group median (outliers)
Check if these outliers are closer to other specialty centroids than expected
Generate overlap coefficient showing severity of misclassification

Individual Case Analysis
Each case (Pages 3+) shows:

Embedding Profile Comparison: 64-dimensional similarity patterns between the misclassified provider vs. typical providers
Procedure/Diagnosis Overlap: What medical services they actually share
Demographics/Cost Patterns: Why the model sees them as similar
PCA Visualization: Spatial positioning showing the overlap

Key Findings From Initial Review
Model Improvements Needed:

E&M Code Cleanup - Model confused by evaluation/management codes (low effort, high impact)
Label Refinement - Spine/Heart hospitals clustering with Orthopedics
Specialty Distinctions - Ambulatory Surgery, Endoscopy, Eye hospitals showing significant overlap

Concerning Overlaps:

Women ↔ Behavioral Health
Children ↔ Behavioral Health
Cancer ↔ VA (most concerning)

Recommended Next Steps
Phase 1 (Quick Wins):

Remove E&M procedure codes from embedding training
Exclude Emergency cost category and place-of-service features

Phase 2: Review and refine problematic label assignments based on detailed case analysis
Let's discuss tomorrow to prioritize these improvements and plan our implementation approach.
Best regards,
[Your Name]
